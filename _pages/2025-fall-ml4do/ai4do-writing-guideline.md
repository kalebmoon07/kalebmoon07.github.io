## AI Writing Policy

Generative AI tools are great helpers for learning, and you are encouraged to use them responsibly. My principle is to promote your genuine thinking and writing, keeping AI as an assistant.
Here are some guidelines to follow.

* **Please disclose which AI tools/models are used** and how you used them in _every report_. This part will not affect your grade, and is not counted in the page limit.
* **Please check the generated content carefully by yourself**. Topics in this course are often technical and complex. AI may not fully understand the nuances and may generate incorrect or misleading content.

You **MAY** use AI (e.g., ChatGPT and other LLMs) for ...

* Reading and understanding course materials, papers to review, and generating summaries to aid your understanding.
* Developing ideas and brainstorming.
* Paragraph-level drafting based on your original ideas.
  * **Clarify which parts are your original contributions.**
* Polishing your writing and improving clarity.
  * Do not focus on beautiful writing; using your own words is encouraged.
* Seeking feedback on your ideas and drafts.

You **MUST NOT** use AI for ...

* Submitting AI-generated content as your own work.
* **Paraphrasing existing content and presenting it as your own**.
  * Do not use AI to summarize **online open reviews** and include them in your work.
  * **OpenReview.net submissions will be compared carefully**.
* Drafting the whole report or the majority of a section as a starting point.
