## Introduction

Recent progress in Machine Learning (ML) has demonstrated its power to tackle NP-hard discrete optimization
problems and improve a decision making process. Enormous research articles are published in
both traditional OR journals and top ML conferences, showing the growing interest in this area.
This course aims to equip students with skills to conduct their own research in ML applications for
discrete optimization. We mainly focus on scheduling and routing problems, as well as general mixed-integer
programming (MIP).

Two main topics are covered:

* (i) **Data-driven algorithm design**, enhancing the performance of optimization algorithms using ML
* (ii) **Data-driven optimization**, making a better decision from learned data.

## Course Logistics

The course is designed to be comprehensive and interactive with the components below. For each topic, a list of reading materials will be provided. Students may propose additional papers to instructor for discussion.

* **Lecture**: The instructor will present the main concepts and techniques.
* **In-class presentation**: Some classes will be reserved for student presentations. An assigned team must select a research paper among the given list and explain it to the class (25 minutes). Each student must be involved in at least one presentation.
* **Referee report**: At the end of each topic, students must select a research paper from the given list and write a referee report with critical analysis (max 2 pages, similar to a peer-review in a ML conference). During the course, four reports will be assigned.
* **Final project**: Students in a team will develop a new method that applies ML to discrete optimization.
  * A proposal must be submitted at the end of week 6 (max 2 pages).
  * In week 11, a highlight talk will be given by each team (5 minutes).
  * The final results will be presented at the end of the course (30 minutes), which will be peer-reviewed by other students.
  * A final report must be submitted (max 16 pages).
